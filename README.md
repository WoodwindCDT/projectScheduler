Work I completed:
- My inspiration for this project was to use as little code as possible
- Detailed CSS was writeen to ensure user was able to see differences for button UI
- Row elements were created using a for loop and classes were added accordingly too
- Added JS to create and store user tasks along with its corresponding time
- 2 buttons were created allowing the User to go "Back to the Top" and to "Reset/Clear" all saved and textarea input
